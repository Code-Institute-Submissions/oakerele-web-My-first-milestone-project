# User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute/O Akerele â€“ First Milestone Project 

***Preamble***<br>
This website is my first milestone project. It is a fake website for a GYM named Fitness Always Gym.<br> 
It is designed to showcase what I have learned so far in HTML and CSS.<br>
This project is designed for people who are interested in getting fit through physical exercises<br> 
for a particular area. The website provides information as to where to find the Gym - address and phone<br> 
number, the time-table for the times they are opened and our social media contact platforms such as Facebook,<br> 
Twitter etc. The whole idea was to create a simple website that is clear and simple to navigate with detailed<br> 
information in as little text as possible.

# User Experience:

The main goal, following the industry standards, was to make website easily accessible, include all<br> 
information required while keeping minimalistic design. It is noteworthy that the website is progressive,<br> 
that is, quite a lot of features can still be added to it and as the gym grows bigger with additional facilities,<br>
they can be introduced to the website.

# Wireframe using Balsamiq:
* Sketching
* Drawings
* Features
* Design with Balsamiq

<a href="/workspace/My-first-milestone-project/master/images/New Wireframe.png">Wireframe</a>

# Existing Features:
There are 4 key pages on this website:
* [Home Page](#home-page)
* [Facilities Page](#facilities-page)
* [Gallery Page](#gallery-page)
* [Contact Us](#contact-page)

Every page is designed to show the header and the footer on top and bottom respectively.<br> 
In the middle are the sections that display the message/information for the page.  The header<br> 
contains the Logo for the gym and the menu for other pages. The logo was designed by myself and the<br> 
menu bar design is borrowed from the Resume project. The footer contains the social media addresses<br> 
of the gym.

## Home page

The Home page includes the logo, and menu bar on the top.  The middle contains the following:<br>

a)  	the about us section<br>
b)	    the front view of the gym<br> 
c)	    the opening times of the gym and<br>
d)	    contact information e.g. address, phone number and email.<br>

As mentioned before, the footer shows social media e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc addresses of the gym for contact purposes.

## Facilities Page

The Facilities page gives information about available services in addition to the Header and Footer. At the moment only,<br> 
6 facilities are available and they are - swimming; cardio; free weight; resistance; fitness and personal training. 

## Gallery Page

The third page is about the equipment, machines and tools available to members for training in pictures.<br> 
This page is meant to advertise the equipment available to potential members to attract them to the gym.

## Contact Us

This page has been linked to the bottom of the home page where the address, the phone number and the email<br> 
address of the gym can be located. 


# Features to implement

As earlier stated, the website  is a work-in-progress and can still be improved upon. In the future, potential members<br> 
will be able to register online to become members and those that just want to use the Gym's services without being<br> 
members will be able to book online for whatever services they want at the time they want it from the comfort of their<br> 
homes as against what obtains now (booking and paying over the phone and in the office).    

# Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create the website:

* Gitpod full template - workspace
* Bootstrap 4.4.1 - used to simplify the structure and to make it responsive.
* FontAwesome 4.7.0 - accessed for social media icons.
* jquery 3.4.1 - used to reference Javascript modal
* Google Fonts - used to style the website fonts.
* Balsamiq - the tool used to create the wireframe.

# Testing

## Header

The header has a logo on the left-hand side and the menu bar at the right-hand side. The Menu contains the name and<br>  
a Font Awesome icon for each of the features. When a user hovers their mouse over the menu, it hovers up to show the<br> 
exact menu item that is to be opened for emphasis and the background color of ash. This has been manually tested and it<br> 
works all across the web pages. Any of the pages can be seen and navigated from every page. It has been tested and found<br> 
to be responsive. The header acts responsively across all resolutions too.
  
## Home Page 

The home page otherwise known as the landing page contains three sections viz: about us/picture of the front view of Fitness Always<br> 
gym; the opening hours and contact details. The about us is a catching statement about the gymnasium to attract new customers.<br>
It shared the row 50:50 with the front view photo of the gym. Section two is the opening hours of the gymnasium. It shows when the gym<br>
is opened in the morning and closed in the night from Monday to Friday. This was styled to be positioned in the center. Finally, the contact<br> 
session shows how the gym could be contacted either by post, telephone and/or email. The section is colored with gold after the menu<br> 
bar contact-us color and linked with the contact page i.e. when the contact page is clicked from the menu bar, it links a user to this contact<br> 
page and it does not matter which page the user is, once the contact page is clicked, it immediately directs the user to this section. This was<br> 
tested across all the devices and it works fine.

## Facilities Page

This page explains to potential customers what services are available in the gym. At the moment, only six services are available but as time<br> 
goes on, the gym will expand and add other services. The services are styled with Font Awesome Icons by the side of the title of each service.<br>
The test carried out on this page was to navigate to it from another page and it works fine. Also, it works nicely across all the devices: mobile<br> 
phone, iPad and desktop. 

## Gallery Page

When a user navigates to this page, it shows the different pictures of machines and tools available for use in the gymnasium. The pictures are<br> 
nicely padded to differentiate them from one another. It has been tested to show these pictures across all the devices and the page can be navigated<br> 
from other pages.
 
## Contact Us Page

This has been explained vividly in section 3 of the home page. When this page is clicked, it takes the user straight to that section of the home page<br>
and this has been tested and found to be true from all other pages.

## Footer

The footer contains just the social media i.e. Facebook; Linkedin; Instagram; Twitter and YouTube. It is designed to share a<br> 
light green color with the facilities menu and centered. It is also designed to be sticky. The social media are represented by<br> 
Font Awesome Icons which are also styled with hover effect when the mouse goes over the icons. This has been tested across all<br> 
the pages and it holds. 

## SPELLING & GRAMMAR

All Fitness Always Gym text content and this Readme file has been been tested for grammar and spelling mistakes through Grammarly.

## The code has been validated using:

#### W3C Mark-up Validation Service and
#### W3C CSS Validation Service

This site has met the objective of creating an online presence with minimalistic design and content, but providing enough<br> 
information and platform to enable fast contact.<br>
The website has been tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and different screen sizes<br> 
(Galaxy C5, various iPhones, Huawei, iPad, iPad Pro and laptops) to make sure it is responsive. Bootstrap has been used<br> 
to achieve this.<br>
All fonts, images and other attributes have been changed accordingly to fit different screen sizes. Media queries have<br>
been used to make them work.


# Deployment 

The site was developed using Gitpod full template - workspace to commit and push to GitHub.<br>
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight<br>
 from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

## The following steps can be taken to access my page from the GitHub repository. 

On Github navigate to my-first-milestone-project<br>
From the menu at the top click on settings<br>
Scroll down to the GitHub pages section<br>
Under Source section click on the dropdown menu and select Master Branch as your GitHub Pages publishing source.<br>
Select save.

## To Clone the Repository
